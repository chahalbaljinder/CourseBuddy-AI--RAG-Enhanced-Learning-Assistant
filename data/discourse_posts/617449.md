“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.”
So I did. 

 Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments 
Yes, I got great marks in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.
But let’s be real…
It was my Labrador who did the actual work 
While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

Solving deployment issues faster than my dev server boots
Writing function calling code like a true GPT whisperer
Fixing LLM bugs that I didn’t even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.
He growled at broken APIs.
I took the credit. 

 Message from the Dog Developer:

“Thank you all for an awesome semester!
I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.
But I am personally offended by one thing…”


“How dare you give bonus marks on Week 7?
I skipped it — just like many — because we were told only best 4 of 7 would count.
I demand justice. And a belly rub.”
– , Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist


 Moral of the story:
Let your pets help with your coursework.
You get the grade. They get the rage.

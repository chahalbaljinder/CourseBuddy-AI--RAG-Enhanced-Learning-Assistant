I submitted the project within the deadline, and I ensured that all requirements were fulfilled, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.
However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.
Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1
I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.
Thank you for your understanding.

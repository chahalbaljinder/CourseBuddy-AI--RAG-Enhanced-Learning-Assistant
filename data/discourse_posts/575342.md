Important Instruction
Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code in Discourse posts. This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: Extended Syntax | Markdown Guide.
A friendly suggestion: kindly go through Discourse Docs!

Hi TDS team, with ROE being ahead, i assume an official thread will be created soon. Here are few doubts from my side. I request the official post to cover these.

Syllabus
kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice
I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time
Any mock or resource to practice from?
additional tips, if any

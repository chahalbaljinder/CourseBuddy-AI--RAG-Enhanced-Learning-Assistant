@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
I have similar concern
For Q1, I used the following code:
print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

And got the following output:
Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.

Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:
print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

and got the following answers:
Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08

The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and Mileage).

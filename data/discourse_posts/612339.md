I have noticed that my image was run on a x86_64 architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is ARM. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error.
This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.


@carlton  same issue, My image was also run on a x86_64 architecture. I too built on my mac which is ARM (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error  and  Evaluation log file is MISSING.
Actually my image was run on x86_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.
I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

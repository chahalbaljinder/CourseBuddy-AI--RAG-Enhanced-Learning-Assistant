@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Greetings sir!
Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. Iâ€™ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?
As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?
Thank you and Regards
Akshit

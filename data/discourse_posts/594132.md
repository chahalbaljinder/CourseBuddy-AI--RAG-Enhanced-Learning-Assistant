Hello @carlton and @Jivraj   and  @s.anand sir
It is becoming quite evident that a lot of us will struggle to get something decent out for the project-1 by saturday and we are struggling here. I request to reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly more odds of submitting the project.
Thanks
Vikram

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as 4.25, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored 7.25 shown after submission.
Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

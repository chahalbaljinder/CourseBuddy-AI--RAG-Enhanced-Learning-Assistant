Right,
I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept.
I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock.
I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.

So here is more questions in the form of a little quiz (shared by someone in the group,DM for Credit )

gkmfrombs.github.io


Quiz from PDF





That has 350 questions if you don’t want to go through all of them(it’s pretty time consuming)
in that case just do this PDF.(This pdf contains all the questions that is a bit conceptual i would say and some questions which i failed to do  )


accounts.google.com


Google Drive: Sign-in
Access Google Drive with a Google account (for personal use) or Google Workspace account (for business use).






(If you know context to the pdf’s name,we are friends )

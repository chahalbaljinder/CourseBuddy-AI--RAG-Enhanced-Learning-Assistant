A sample evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub
You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.
Please note:

This is a sample. It WILL change.
Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It WILL change.
LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:

Your code gives correct results reliably (i.e. try a few times)
Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations


Your AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
For those who submit their code by Friday, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini - please socialize this during the live sessions.

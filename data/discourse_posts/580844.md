Hi Shalini,
We are aware of the issue and @s.anand is working on a solution. The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed.
The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions.
Kind regards

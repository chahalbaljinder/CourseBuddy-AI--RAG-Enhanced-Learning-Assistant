@carlton sir
Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.
I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered 
Kind regards,

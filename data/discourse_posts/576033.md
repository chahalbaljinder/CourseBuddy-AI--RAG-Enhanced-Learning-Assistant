Dear all,
I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course: LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator.  This is the basic prototype.
This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.
A heartfelt thanks to @s.anand, our course instructor, and TAs @Carlton and @Jivraj, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.
I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

Expand functionality and evaluation models.
Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The GitHub repository is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!

Best regards,
Avinash Shrivastava
